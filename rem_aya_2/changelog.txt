 * HATEOAS tests.  
 *  some methods made to shorten code assertions on those tests. Cool, but i think i'll no do this again. Because if i have a fail,
 *  need to "unclean" putting it again on top to see which line is not asserting.
 *  Keep each assertion in each method might be faster than debug always that i have an assert error.
