 * HATEOAS tests.  
  * some methods made to shorten code assertions on those tests. Cool, but i think i'll no do this again. Because if i have a fail,
  * need to "unclean" putting it again on top to see which line is not asserting.
  * Keep each assertion in each method might be faster than debug always that i have an assert error.

 * StackOverFlowError
  * don't ever trust in auto-complete, nah...
  * it made a recursive calling in overrided methods.

 *for some reason, when created PlantControllerTestCORS , the webEnvironment was not the same used in other classes (like SwaggerIntegrationTest)
 *so, copy SwaggerIntegrationTests and did the necessary changes on code to turn into desired class and fix it.

 *when used @XmlRootElement to map object TokenVO into tests, it was no being mapped and deserealized by XmlMapper.
 *now (in Jdk21 and SpringBoot 3.2.1) I'd found that is necessary to pass a name to fix it.
 *so make the line of annotation @XmlRootElement(name = "TokenVO").

 *when testing in postman, the service for patch verb was working correctly.
 *but when testing it, it was no patching in right time. Into the referent test, the object was not modified,
  *but in next test (testFindById) it was correctly patched.
 *so separate service by two and made an if else on controller to choose service.
