 * HATEOAS tests.  
  * some methods made to shorten code assertions on those tests. Cool, but i think i'll no do this again. Because if i have a fail,
  * need to "unclean" putting it again on top to see which line is not asserting.
  * Keep each assertion in each method might be faster than debug always that i have an assert error.
